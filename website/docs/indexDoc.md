# Rules
- "Rules? We don't need no stinkin rules!"  Blazing Saddles: Well it was badges for them
- "You make all the rules, in this game of fools"  Face-2-Face: 10-9-8

- Attack your friends, attack your enemies, attack yourself!  Just __DO NOT ATTACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE!__

- The machines you are given will die at the end of the event sooooo....  Yes you can: __rm -rf /__ or __:(){ :|:& };:__ but, do you really want to?  Commands like this will only stop you from scoring.

- Feel free to experiment, no one is going to be upset at the end of event if a machine is not working.
