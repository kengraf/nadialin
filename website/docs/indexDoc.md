- The machines you are given will die at the end of the event sooooo....  Yes you can: __rm -rf /__ or __:(){ :|:& };:__ but, do you really want to?  Commands like this will only take away your opportunity to score more points.

- Feel free to experiment, no one is going to be upset at the end of the event if a machine is not working.
