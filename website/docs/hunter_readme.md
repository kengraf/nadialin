## Rules
> "You make all the rules, in this game of fools" - Face-2-Face: 10-9-8

> "Bollocks to the rules!" - Lord of the Flies
- Attack your friends, attack your enemies, attack yourself!   Just __DO NOT ATTACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE!__


> Rules are not necessarily sacred, principles are. - Franklin D. Roosevelt

> I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care. - Lou Holtz
- The machines you are given will die at the end of the event sooooo....  Yes you can: __rm -rf /__ or __:(){ :|:& };:__ but, do you really want to?  Destorying things will only take away your opprotunity to score more points.

> "Hell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something." - Thomas A. Edison
- Feel free to experiment, no one is going to be upset at the end of the event if a machine is not working.
